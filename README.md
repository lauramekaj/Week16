Purpose of this task was to create some types of files: one file of 1 KiloByte, 1 Megabyte, other one of 10 MB.
In this case we will have to compare three of these files according to the speed of the three files which varies.
For 1KB file the speed was recorded to be between 1.5-1.7 Mbps.
For 1MB file the speed was recorded to be between 114-177 Mbps.
And for 10MB file the speed was recorded to be between 351-459 Mbps.
These statistics differ or are an effect of also the power of the computer.
After that we should try to establish a connection with the other computer and to have the chance to exchange files or to copy files in that computer.
After it is done then there will be also the part where we can measure the traffic through the tcpdump command.
